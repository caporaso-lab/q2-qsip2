# q2-qsip2

A [QIIME 2](https://qiime2.org) plugin [developed](https://develop.qiime2.org) by Colin Wood (colin.wood@nau.edu). ðŸ”Œ

## Installation instructions

### Install Prerequisites

[Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) provides the `conda` environment and package manager, and is currently the only supported way to install QIIME 2.
Follow the instructions for downloading and installing Miniconda.

After installing Miniconda and opening a new terminal, make sure you're running the latest version of `conda`:

```bash
conda update conda
```

###  Install development version of `q2-qsip2`

Next, you need to get into the top-level `q2-qsip2` directory.
You can achieve this by [cloning the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository), for example with the command:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/colinvwood/q2-qsip2.git
```

Once you have the directory on your computer, change (`cd`) into it.

If you're in a conda environment, deactivate it by running `conda deactivate`.

Then, run:

```shell
conda env create -n q2-qsip2-dev --file ./environments/q2-qsip2-qiime2-amplicon-2024.5.yml
```

After this completes, activate the new environment you created by running:

```shell
conda activate q2-qsip2-dev
```

Finally, run:

```shell
make install
```

## Testing and using the most recent development version of `q2-qsip2`

After completing the install steps above, confirm that everything is working as expected by running:

```shell
make test
```

You should get a report that tests were run, and you should see that all tests passed and none failed.
It's usually ok if some warnings are reported.

If all of the tests pass, you're ready to use the plugin.
Start by making QIIME 2's command line interface aware of `q2-qsip2` by running:

```shell
qiime dev refresh-cache
```

You should then see the plugin in the list of available plugins if you run:

```shell
qiime info
```

You should be able to review the help text by running:

```shell
qiime qsip2 --help
```
